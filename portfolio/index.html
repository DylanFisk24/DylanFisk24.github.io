            <div class="portfoliop"><p>This feasibility study was written for a class in the Professional Writing and Technical Communication certificate program at UMass Amherst. It outlines a project I came up with for the course regarding water-related health safety measures.</p>
            <p>This work demonstrates my ability to adhere to the memo format of professional communication and to consider the realistic components of my own innovative ideas.</p></div>

            <div class="portfoliop"><p>This portfolio serves as a compilation of my most fleshed out creative works from my college years. It opens with a personal narrative and includes poetry (both long and short form) and my first ever short story.</p>
            <p>This portfolio offers a variety of different styles and subjects that my writing has entailed and serves as a great introduction to my interests as a writer.</div>

            <a href="./tutoring-philosophy.pdf">View the philosophy (PDF)</a></div>
            <div class="portfoliop"><p>This tutoring philosophy was created for the first of two courses I was required to take to become a tutor at UMass Amherst. It lays out the beliefs I hold about writing, tutoring, and the role of writing centers as well as the essential components of my practice as a tutor.</p>
            <p>Writing this has given me a new perspective on what it means to be a writer and how we can best come alongside those who are struggling with the process.</p></div>

            <div class="portfoliop"><p>I wrote this essay for an early British literature course I took at UMass Amherst. It dissects the famous English epic <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> by John Milton in order to understand the rhetorical strategies present in Satan’s arguments toward Eve in the garden of Eden.</p>
            <p>This work demonstrates my ability to deeply understand and analyze text, combining the text’s own language with my interpretation to bring about novel ideas.</p></div>
