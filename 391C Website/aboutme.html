        <h2>Hi there!</h2>    
            <p>I'm Dylan, an undergraduate English major at UMass-Amherst in the Professional Writing and Technical Communication certificate program and the Creative Writing concentration.
            I also work as a tutor intern in the UMass Writing Center, helping me be exposed to more unique kinds of writing.
            Through refining my own writing and experiencing the writing of others, I hope to prepare myself for a fruitful career in writing or editing.</p>
            
        <h2>What you should know:</h2>
            <p>Writing has always been a great asset for me, especially in its ability to express my faith and give form to my feelings, and my time at UMass-Amherst has been but the start of my long journey with it. It is there that I am able to experiment with both the creative writing I am passionate about and the technical writing I am eager to learn.</p> 
            <p>Though a poet at heart, I am interested in every facet of writing and the writing process. In immersing myself in multiple distinct genres, I am hoping to become a versatile word-slinger. I have already been able to produce a creative writing portfolio and multiple pieces of professional writing from my courses.</p>
            <p>Being a tutor in UMass' writing center has been such a privilege for me as well, as it gives me the chance to combine my love of writing with my desire to help others. I have already been exposed to pieces from many different disciplines and dialects, and in so doing, my passion and knowledge of writing has continued to grow.</p>
            <p>In the future, I would love to pursue a career that continues to align with this intersection of writing and serving others. I value writing's versatility, so I do not have a concrete field chosen quite yet, but honing my skills at UMass will help qualify me for any writing, editing, or teaching position I feel called to!</p>
