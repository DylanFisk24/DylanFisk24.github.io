            <h2>Speedrunning</h2>
            <p>Over the past five years, one of my most prominent preoccupations has been speedrunning some of my favorite video games. What began as simply a means of passing the abundance of free time acquired from the COVID-19 pandemic soon became a long-standing passion of mine. As I continued lowering my times for each game, I fell in love with the continual pushing of my limits as I strived for excellence. As of now, I have uploaded speedruns for ten video games.</p>

            <h2>Twitch Streaming</h2>
            <p>My career as a live streamer on twitch.tv stemmed naturally from my newfound passion for speedrunning. As I learned the runs and improved my times, I was excited to share this process with others, and live streaming became the avenue through which I could both document and share my progress. <img class="pretzel" src="../images/pretzel-logo.png" alt="The SingularPretzel logo, depicting a pretzel with a purple top hat."> Ever since, streaming has helped me connect with new communities, find new friends, and expand my internet presence.</p>
