        <h2>Speedrunning</h2>
            <p>Over the past five years, one of my most prominent preoccupations has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrunning" target="_blank">speedrunning</a> some of my favorite video games. What began as simply a means of passing the abundance of free time acquired from the COVID-19 pandemic soon became a long-standing passion of mine. As I continued lowering my times for each game, I fell in love with the continual pushing of my limits as I strived for excellence. As of now, I have uploaded speedruns for nine video games. These games are listed below in the order I've run them, along with my current <abbr title="Personal Bests">PBs</abbr> for each:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><i>A Hat in Time</i> - 37m 10s 700ms (<dfn title="A common speedrunning category where the goal is to simply beat the game as quickly as possible, without any other special objectives.">Any%</dfn>, Lag Abuse)</li>
                <li><i>Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</i> - 27m 24s 580ms (Hero Story)</li>

        <h2>Twitch Streaming</h2>
            <p>My career as a live streamer on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">twitch.tv</a> stemmed naturally from my newfound passion for speedrunning. As I learned the runs and improved my times, I was excited to share this process with others, and live streaming became the avenune through which I could both document and share my progress. Ever since, streaming has helped me connect with new communities, find new friends, and expand my internet presence. Some of my accomplishments include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reaching <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/joining-the-affiliate-program?language=en_US" target="_blank">affiliate status</a> on Twitch, allowing monetization of my content</li>
                <li>Surpassing 150 followers</li>
                <li>Building a small community through Discord, housing over 40 members</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I hope to see you all in my stream chat real soon!</p>
