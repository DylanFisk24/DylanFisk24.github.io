                <h2>Sample Feasibility Study</h2>
                <p>This feasibility study was written for a class in the Professional Writing and Technical Communication certificate program at UMass Amherst. It outlines the project I had come up with for which I later had to write a grant proposal. This work demonstrates my ability to adhere to the memo format of professional communication and to consider the realistic components of my own innovative ideas.</p>

                <h2>Creative Writing Portfolio</h2>
                <p>This portfolio serves as a compilation of my most fleshed out creative works from my college years. It opens with a personal narrative and includes poetry (both long and short form) and my first ever short story. This portfolio offers a variety of different styles and subjects that my writing has entailed and serves as a great introduction to my interests as a writer.</p>

                <h2>Writing Center Tutoring Philosophy</h2>
                <p>This tutoring philosophy was created for the first of two courses I was required to take to become a tutor at UMass Amherst. It lays out the beliefs I hold about writing, tutoring, and the role of writing centers as well as the essential components of my practice as a tutor. Writing this has given me a new perspective on what it means to be a writer and how we can best come alongside those who are struggling with the process.</p>

                <h2>Paradise Lost Analysis Essay</h2>
                <p>I wrote this essay for an early British literature course I took at UMass Amherst. It dissects the famous English epic Paradise Lost by John Milton in order to understand the rhetorical strategies present in Satan’s arguments toward Eve in the garden of Eden. This work demonstrates my ability to deeply understand and analyze text, combining the text’s own language with my interpretation to bring about novel ideas.</p>
