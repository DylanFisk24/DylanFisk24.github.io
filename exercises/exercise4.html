    <h1>Potential Images for Website</h1>
    <p>This photo could help emphasize the overarching theme of writing that will be permeating my website. Using an image like this on the webpage of my creative writing protfolio, for example, could emphasize that it is my own writing while adding a bit of atmosphere to the page.</p>

    <p>I can use this photo to reinforce UMass' role in my writng development, especially by showcasing South College, the building most closely associated with the Humanities and Fine Arts which English is a part of.</p>

    <p>I think this photo will help to personalize my webpage by giving an authentic view of my life as a student. The backpack around my shoulder helps illustrate that student side of things without me explicitly saying it.</p>
